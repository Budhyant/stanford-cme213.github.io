“When you are stuck in a traffic jam with a Porsche, all you do is burn more gas in idle. Scalability is about building wider roads, not about building faster cars.”

# Data distribution

Several steps are required

Assume process 0 has matrix $A$ and $B$

---
class: middle

1. Process 0 sends $a\_{ij}$ and $b\_{ij}$ to process $(i,j,0)$
2. Process $(i,j,0)$ sends $a\_{ij}$ to $(i,j,j)$, and $b\_{ij}$ to $(i,j,i)$
3. $(i,j,j)$ broadcasts $a\_{ij}$ to $(i,\*,j)$, and $(i,j,i)$ broadcasts $b\_{ij}$ to $(\*,j,i)$

Process $(i,j,k)$ computes $a\_{ik} b\_{kj}$.

MPI functions that will be needed:

1. That's a scatter. `MPI_Scatterv`
2. That's a send/recv. `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv`
3. That's a broadcast. `MPI_Bcast`

---

Scatter and broadcast are collective communications.

But only a subset of processes are involved in the communication.

---
class: middle

1. 0 &rarr; $(i,j,0)$
2. P2P
3. $(i,j,j)$ &rarr; $(i,\*,j)$, $(i,j,i)$ &rarr; $(\*,j,i)$

We will need two concepts:

1. MPI topology
2. MPI groups and communicators

# MPI topology

We need a grid topology.

Arranges all processes logically on a 3D grid $(i,j,k)$.

# Exercise

[mpi_cart.cpp](https://github.com/stanford-cme213/stanford-cme213.github.io/blob/master/Code/Lecture_18/mpi_cart.cpp)

Use the `mpi8` VM on GCP

All the files are in the [Code/Lecture_18](https://github.com/stanford-cme213/stanford-cme213.github.io/tree/master/Code/Lecture_18) folder

---
class: middle

Next step is to create sub-groups of processes for the collective communications.

We will need 4 types of sub-groups:

1. $(\*,\*,k)$
2. $(\*,j,k)$
3. $(i,\*,k)$
4. $(i,j,\*)$ (for the final reduction over $k$)

---

Let's do a broadcast inside along the $i$ axis.

We need groups of the type $(\*,j,k)$.
