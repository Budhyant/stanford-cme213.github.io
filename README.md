If you find errors and want some changes to this material, please use the [Issues](https://github.com/stanford-cme213/stanford-cme213.github.io/issues) tab above.

You can also make changes to this repository to be incorporated later by the instructor of the class. This is a three step process.

1. Create a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) of this repository. This creates your own private copy of all the files. You are going to use this to make your changes. Use the fork ([fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)) icon above (top right of the screen, next to Watch and Star). 

2. Make changes to the files in your forked repository. This follows the usual git process ([git cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)). `git add ...`; `git commit -m "description of changes"`; `git push`. Once you are happy with your changes go to step 3.

3. Make a pull request. This will send a request to the owner of this site to incorporate your changes in this repository. The process is fairly straighforward. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
